    - [Tampermonkey for Chrome](https://tampermonkey.net/?ext=dhdg&browser=chrome)
    - [Tampermonkey for Firefox](https://tampermonkey.net/?ext=dhdg&browser=firefox)
    - [Tampermonkey for Safari](https://tampermonkey.net/?ext=dhdg&browser=safari)
2. Click on the script file to view it, then click the "Raw" button to open the raw script file.
4. Tampermonkey should automatically recognize the script and display an installation window. 
5. Click on "Install" to proceed with the script installation.

After installation, the script will be active and functioning in your browser. With Tampermonkey, you can easily manage, disable, or remove installed scripts by selecting the "Dashboard" option from the Tampermonkey icon in your browser toolbar.

### Installation with Userscripts (app for iOS)
If you are an _iOS_ user, you can use **Userscripts** to enable scripts on Safari.
1. Install the [Userscripts app from the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/userscripts/id1463298887).
2. Open the Userscripts app on your iOS device after installing it.
3. Navigate to the desired script in the GitHub `/scripts` directory using the integrated browser in the Userscripts app or a browser on your device, and download the script to your device locally or to iCloud Drive.
4. In the app, set the _Userscripts Directory_ where you have uploaded the scripts you previously downloaded.
5. Ensure that the Userscripts app is enabled as a browser extension on your iOS device to allow script execution. Go to _Settings > Safari > Extensions_ (or whichever browser you use) and make sure Userscripts is enabled.

Now you should be able to use the script on supported web pages when browsing with your iOS device.
